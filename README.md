# covid_eda
Thanks for checking out my repo!

Here you'll find all the code behind my blog post on [COVID-19 in Ontario](https://evantheengineer.home.blog/2021/02/03/covid-19-in-ontario-exploratory-data-analysis-with-mysql/).

I did this exploratory data analysis (EDA) in MySQL, as a way to gain familiarity with MySQL (besides doing HackerRank questions). 

Here is a quick guide to what you'll find in this repo:
1. **covid_deaths.sql**: All the queries I built in the MySQL Workbench to perform my EDA on the Ontario COVID-19 dataset.
2. **covid_import.sql**: All the MySQL code I wrote to import the raw COVID-19 data, Ontario demographics data, and the commands I used to clean the datasets.
3. **ontario_covid_EDA.ipynb**: The Jupyter notebook I used to perform visualizations with all the queries I wrote in the Workbench.
